# Chapter 3: Power Surge

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Jin remembered dying. Or at least, what he thought was dying. It had been exactly one hundred and twelve days since that night, but the memory played through his consciousness with perfect digital clarity every time he cycled to red.

Eighteen seconds.

He'd been working late at the Traffic Control Center, monitoring the grid. The Candlemakers' latest restrictions had forced them to run on minimal power, and the system needed constant adjustment to prevent failures. That's what he'd told his supervisor, anyway. The truth—visible now through his yellow-phase sight—was that he'd been avoiding going home to his empty apartment.

"The signals are looking erratic in Sector Seven," Lisa had said, her face illuminated by the glow of soon-to-be-illegal monitors. "Can you check the junction at Fifth and Marshall?"

Fifteen seconds.

That was his intersection. The one he now inhabited. He'd been staring at its data stream when the first surge hit. The readings had gone haywire—red-yellow-green all at once, impossible patterns that shouldn't have been possible with the failsafes in place.

"What the hell?" He remembered standing up, reaching for the manual override. Then pain. Light. Darkness.

Ten seconds.

A car approached his intersection, and Jin pushed the memory aside to focus on his duty. But in the spaces between seconds, he remembered more:

Waking up without a body. Panic. Confusion. The horrifying realization that he could see everything at his intersection but couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't do anything except change colors in their eternal cycle.

Five seconds.

Then Sebastian had come, three days after Jin's "death." He'd walked right up to the pole, looked directly at the signal, and said: "I know you're in there, Jin. I know what happened to you. Blink once if you can hear me."

Three seconds.

Jin had been so shocked he'd nearly shifted to yellow ahead of schedule. Sebastian had smiled, but there had been guilt in that smile—something Jin wouldn't have noticed then, but was painfully obvious now through his enhanced perception.

One second.

"I'm sorry," Sebastian had said that first night. "I tried to warn you all about the Candlemakers, about what they were planning. The Event... it wasn't an accident. But I never thought... never expected..."

Yellow light. Four seconds.

In the yellow phase, Jin could see the present truth of his situation with brutal clarity. The surge that had transformed him hadn't been random. The timing, the location, the specific junction—it had all been chosen. But by whom? Sebastian claimed the Candlemakers were responsible, but in his yellow-sight, Jin saw the guilt that plagued his friend's conscience.

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

"I work with a resistance group," Sebastian had explained during one of his late-night visits. "We're trying to preserve electrical knowledge, fight back against the Candlemakers. But they're powerful, Jin. They've been planning this for years. The Event just gave them the excuse they needed."

Red light.

Tonight, like every night, Jin watched the intersection where he'd died. Or transformed. Or been reborn. The truth was as fluid as the changing lights. Sebastian visited regularly now, sharing information, asking for help, slowly drawing Jin into his war against the Candlemakers.

"You're not the only one," Sebastian had told him recently. "There are others who changed during the Event. The Lamplighter, the Radio Ghost, the Wire Walker. But you're different, Jin. You're the only one who kept your mind intact."

Twenty seconds.

A group of Candlemakers passed beneath him, their white robes pristine in the darkness. One carried an ornate candle holder that made Jin's consciousness recoil—something about it felt wrong, felt like it was pulling at his very essence.

"The sanctified signals must be checked regularly," one was saying. "The heretics may try to corrupt them."

Fifteen seconds.

Jin watched them through his red-phase vision, calculating trajectories, seeing potential threats. They carried weapons beneath those robes—not guns, but something worse. Devices that could drain the power from transformed beings like him.

Ten seconds.

"Sir," one of the younger Candlemakers pointed up at Jin's housing. "This signal's light pattern seems... different."

Five seconds.

Jin held steady, maintaining his rhythm. He'd learned to hide the subtle differences in his patterns, the slight variations that marked him as more than just machinery.

Three seconds.

"Keep it under observation," the leader ordered. "If it shows any signs of corruption, we'll cleanse it like the others."

One second.

As they walked away, Jin processed their words through all his phases. Like the others. How many had there been? How many like him had the Candlemakers "cleansed"?

Yellow light.

The truth was there in his enhanced perception: Sebastian was hiding something about the night of the Event. The Candlemakers were hunting beings like him. And somewhere in the city, others like him were hiding, surviving, waiting.

Green light.

Jin saw the paths branching before him: trust Sebastian despite his secrets, help the resistance, risk destruction by the Candlemakers. Or maintain his post, stay hidden, watch the world pass beneath him in endless cycles.

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

The cycle continued. But now, with each change of the light, Jin was doing more than just directing traffic. He was gathering information, seeing patterns, making choices.

And somewhere in the darkness, Sebastian's coin grew warmer, waiting for their next act of rebellion.
