# The Last Light

In a world where artificial light is forbidden, the city of Lumina paradoxically gleams with countless forbidden candles and lanterns. Once a beacon of technological progress, the city now exists in a perpetual twilight after the mysterious Event that made electricity lethal to human touch. The towering steel structures of the old world stand as dark monuments, their electronic hearts long silent.

The Candlemakers Guild maintains order through their monopoly on "safe" illumination, crafting specially blessed candles that supposedly ward off the creatures that emerge from unnaturally dark spaces. Their influence grows with each passing day, as does their persecution of "Illegal Luminaries" – those who dare to create unauthorized sources of light.

Our story follows Jin Chen, a cynical former traffic signal engineer who awakens after the Event to find his consciousness fractured between human and machine. Trapped in an endless cycle of red-yellow-green, he experiences time differently at each signal change – red brings memories of accidents he couldn't prevent, yellow shows him uncomfortable truths about human nature, and green reveals paths that people choose to ignore. His newfound powers force him to watch humanity's daily struggles from a unique vantage point, unable to look away from the patterns of human failure that repeat endlessly before him.

In Lumina, shadows hold memories of the electric age, and darkness itself seems to hunger for the city's remaining light. As Jin observes the world through his tricolored lens, he discovers that the Event may not have been an accident, and that his cursed perspective might be the key to understanding humanity's true nature.

Welcome to a city where hope flickers like a candle flame, where the past casts long shadows, and where a misanthropic traffic light might be humanity's reluctant guardian.
