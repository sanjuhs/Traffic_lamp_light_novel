# Chapter 4: Dark Democracy

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Through his red-phase vision, Jin watched the shadows lengthen unnaturally beneath the magical barrier that blocked out the sun. The "Divine Shroud," they called it—a feat of corrupt politics dressed up as religious necessity. He remembered the day they'd voted it into existence, back when he still had a body to cast a vote with.

Eighteen seconds.

"The motion to implement the Celestial Protection Act has passed," Mayor Chen had announced, his hands trembling as he read from the gilded scroll. Behind him, Madame Wicks stood perfectly still, her wax mask catching the last rays of natural sunlight this city would ever see. "For the safety and prosperity of our citizens, the Candlemakers Guild will now provide blessed illumination to all districts."

Fifteen seconds.

A delivery truck passed beneath Jin's intersection, its cargo hold filled with sanctified candles. Through his enhanced perception, he could see the dark things clinging to its undercarriage—writhing shapes that recoiled from the blessed light but never quite let go. The driver, like most citizens, had learned not to look too closely at the shadows.

"Pull over!" A Candlemaker patrol stepped into the street, their white robes pristine despite the perpetual twilight. "Random inspection for unauthorized illumination devices!"

Ten seconds.

Jin remembered Sebastian's bitter explanation: "They knew exactly what they were doing. Block out the sun, let the dark things in, then sell us protection from the very danger they created. Classic protection racket, just with cosmic consequences."

Five seconds.

The truck driver was sweating now, and Jin's yellow-phase sight was already bleeding through, showing him why: hidden beneath the legitimate cargo of blessed candles was a cache of battery-powered LED lights. The Electric Light Makers' latest attempt to circumvent the monopoly.

Three seconds.

"Nothing here but authorized candles," the driver said, his voice steady despite his fear. Jin had seen this dance before. The Electric Light Makers had grown bolder since the Divine Shroud went up, smuggling forbidden technology to those who couldn't afford the Candlemakers' increasingly expensive "protection."

One second.

The patrol leader stepped closer, raising one of those ornate candleholders that made Jin's consciousness recoil. Not just a light source—a detection device. The flame flickered blue when near unauthorized power sources.

Yellow light. Four seconds.

The truth revealed itself in layers: the driver was part of the resistance, but so was one of the patrol members. The inspection was a show, a careful choreography of pretended diligence. Jin saw the subtle hand signals exchanged, the meaningful glances that ensured the contraband would go undiscovered.

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

"All clear," the patrol leader announced, lowering his detector. "Proceed with caution. The darkness grows hungry at this hour."

As if to emphasize his point, something large and silent moved through the shadows between buildings. The dark things had grown bolder since the Divine Shroud went up, as if drawn to the artificial twilight. The Candlemakers claimed their blessed flames were the only protection—but Jin had seen the truth in his yellow phase. The creatures feared any light. The Candlemakers had simply monopolized the right to provide it.

Red light.

"It was a unanimous vote," Sebastian had told him during one of their late-night conversations. "Every single member of the city council. Know why? Because Madame Wicks had something on each of them. Blackmail, bribery, threats—whatever it took. But mostly, she had their families. Hard to vote against someone who can guarantee the darkness won't touch your children."

Twenty seconds.

A memory surfaced: the public demonstration before the vote. Madame Wicks had brought one of the dark things into the council chamber—contained, but visible. A writhing mass of shadow and hunger that made hardened politicians weep. Then she'd lit one of her blessed candles, and the creature had shrieked and dissolved.

Fifteen seconds.

What the public hadn't seen was the electrical generator in the basement of the council building, deliberately shut down just before the demonstration. Jin knew now, through his enhanced perception, that any light would have banished the creature. But fear and political theater had won the day.

Ten seconds.

The truck disappeared around a corner, its illicit cargo of simple LED lights treated like weapons of mass destruction. Above the city, the Divine Shroud rippled with unnatural colors, a constant reminder of the day democracy had been traded for illumination.

Five seconds.

Something moved in the darkness again, closer this time. Jin could see it clearly in his red phase: a shape that had no right to exist in physical space, all angles and hunger. It shied away from his traffic light, but its movement had purpose. It was hunting.

Three seconds.

A scream echoed from a nearby alley. Someone's blessed candle had gone out, or they'd failed to make this month's payment to the Guild. The dark things were always quickest to find those who couldn't afford protection.

One second.

"The system works as intended," Madame Wicks had said after the vote, her wax mask emotionless in the new twilight. "Light is precious. Precious things have a price. Those who cannot pay..." She'd let the sentence hang, like the Divine Shroud itself, a constant threat above the city.

Yellow light.

Jin saw the truth of it all: the calculated cruelty, the manufactured scarcity, the deliberate breeding of fear. But he also saw something else—growing resistance, hidden networks of electrical light, people fighting back against the enforced darkness.

Green light.

The paths forward were complex, branching. The Electric Light Makers were gaining support, but so were the creatures of darkness. The city balanced on a knife's edge between revolution and total surrender to the artificial night.

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

The cycle continued, but with each rotation, Jin gathered more information. The Candlemakers had won the vote, but they hadn't won every heart. In the shadows of their manufactured twilight, hope still flickered—electric and defiant.

And somewhere in the darkness, another blessed candle went out, and another scream began.
