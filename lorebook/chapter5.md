# Chapter 5: False Light

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

"This is going to feel strange," Sebastian said, attaching something to Jin's housing. A modified power converter, salvaged from before the Event. "But we need you at the gathering."

Jin had never been moved before. Not since becoming... this. The prospect was both terrifying and thrilling. Through his red-phase vision, he could see the potential disasters of disconnection—system failures, power surges, loss of consciousness.

Fifteen seconds.

"Your powers have grown," Sebastian continued, working quickly. "You're not just a traffic light anymore. You're something new. The others need to see—" He stopped abruptly. Through his enhanced perception, Jin saw Sebastian's hands trembling slightly.

Ten seconds.

The disconnection felt like dying again. But this time, Jin remained aware. His consciousness expanded beyond its usual intersection, stretching through improvised circuits Sebastian had somehow woven into a portable housing. The three phases of his perception blurred and overlapped.

Yellow-Red-Green all at once.

The underground gathering place was a former subway station, now filled with the soft hum of illegal generators and the whispers of the resistance. Jin's new housing gave him a 360-degree view, his traffic light consciousness adapting to process multiple angles simultaneously.

Through overlapping phases, he saw:

Red: Potential catastrophes multiplied by dozens of attendees, paths of destruction and salvation interweaving.
Yellow: The truth of the resistance—fear, desperation, and something darker beneath their hope.
Green: Optimal paths that none of them could take, because the game was rigged from the start.

"Brothers and sisters," Sebastian addressed the crowd, setting Jin's housing on a makeshift pedestal. "I bring you proof that we can fight back. That technology can be more than just light—it can be transformed, elevated!"

Jin's consciousness flickered through his phases rapidly, processing the gathered crowd. He saw their LED lights, battery-powered and brave, but ultimately inadequate. Through his yellow-phase truth-sight, he watched a dark thing pass through the station's deeper shadows, unaffected by the electrical illumination.

"The Candlemakers are right about one thing," an older woman spoke up. "Our lights don't stop the worst of them. Not the big ones. Not the ones that come at midnight."

Sebastian's face tightened. "That's why we need more than just light. We need what Jin has become. Watch—"

He pulled out his coin, and Jin felt that resonance again. But this time, with his enhanced perception, he saw more. The coin wasn't just transformed metal; it was a key to something else, something that made his traffic light consciousness recoil and expand simultaneously.

Jin pulsed his lights in sequence: Red-Yellow-Green. But now, after months of evolution, each color carried new power:

Red didn't just show danger—it created zones of temporal distortion, slowing time itself.
Yellow pierced more than truth—it stripped away layers of reality, revealing the mechanisms beneath.
Green didn't merely suggest paths—it could bend probability, subtly nudging events toward optimal outcomes.

The gathered resistance members gasped as the demonstration warped the space around them. But through his yellow-phase sight, Jin saw their awe was tinged with fear. They weren't seeing a solution to their problems. They were seeing something that scared them as much as the darkness did.

"The Electric Light Makers," Sebastian continued, his voice carrying an edge Jin had never heard before, "are more than just smugglers and engineers. We're learning to transform technology itself. To make it... something else."

That's when Jin saw it, in his overlapped perception: Sebastian wasn't just fighting the Candlemakers. He was trying to create something new, something that walked the line between technology and whatever power the Candlemakers wielded. The resistance members weren't just victims fighting back—they were test subjects in an experiment they didn't fully understand.

A distant roar echoed through the tunnels. One of the midnight horrors, drawn perhaps by the concentration of power. The electrical lights flickered, useless against such darkness. But Jin's traffic light consciousness blazed stronger, his three-phase perception cutting through layers of shadow.

"Even the transformed lights aren't enough against those," someone whispered. "Nothing is."

Sebastian's hand tightened around his coin. "Not yet. But we're learning. Jin is proof that we can change the rules. That technology can become something more. Something that can fight the darkness on its own terms."

But Jin, cycling through his enhanced phases, saw the truth Sebastian wasn't telling them: the resistance leader was as scared as anyone else. He was selling hope because the alternative was surrender, even though he knew their chances were far worse than he admitted.

The roar came again, closer. Jin pulsed his lights in warning, and in his red phase, he saw the horror approaching—a mass of angles and hunger that electrical light simply passed through. His yellow phase revealed its true nature: something that didn't belong in their reality, that couldn't be fought with either candles or circuits alone.

"Meeting's over," Sebastian announced, already moving to reconnect Jin to his portable housing. "Everyone out. Different routes, just like we practiced."

As the resistance scattered, Jin cycled through his phases one last time, processing everything he'd learned. The Electric Light Makers were dabbling with forces they didn't understand, trying to bridge the gap between technology and whatever cosmic power the Candlemakers had harnessed.

And somewhere in the darkness of the tunnels, something that cared nothing for either side was getting closer, drawn to the scent of their desperate experiments.

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

The cycle continued, but now Jin understood that neither side had the full answer. The true horror wasn't the darkness or the politics—it was the fact that humanity was caught between powers it couldn't possibly control, playing with forces that saw them as nothing more than pawns in a game they couldn't comprehend.

And in his yellow phase, Jin saw that Sebastian knew this too. He was just better at hiding his despair behind the mask of resistance.
