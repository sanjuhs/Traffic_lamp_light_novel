# Chapter 1: Red Light

Jin Chen had been watching the same intersection for what felt like centuries, though his internal clock—still precise despite everything—told him it had only been three months, four days, and seventeen hours since he'd become... whatever he was now.

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Time stretched like molasses during the red phase. He observed a businessman in an ill-fitting suit checking his watch, tapping his foot impatiently at the crossing. Jin could see it all: the worn heel of the man's right shoe, the thread coming loose on his jacket sleeve, the way his fingers twitched toward his pocket where an illegal smartphone lay hidden. In exactly eighteen seconds, this man would attempt to jaywalk, nearly colliding with the delivery truck that would run the yellow light.

Fifteen seconds.

Jin wanted to scream a warning, but he had no voice. Only light. Red, yellow, green. The eternal cycle that had become his prison and his perspective on the world. During the red phase, he saw every potential accident, every near-miss, every possible tragedy in excruciating detail. It was his curse to watch, unable to intervene beyond his programmed function.

Ten seconds.

The businessman's weight shifted forward. A drop of sweat rolled down his temple despite the autumn chill. Behind him, a young mother with a stroller waited patiently, her baby cooing at pigeons. She, at least, would stay put. The delivery truck was already visible in Jin's peripheral awareness, the driver arguing with someone on his earpiece about delayed schedules.

Five seconds.

Before the Event, Jin had been a traffic signal engineer. He'd spent his days optimizing light patterns, studying traffic flow, trying to make the city move more efficiently. He'd been good at his job, if not particularly passionate about it. Now, the bitter irony of his transformation wasn't lost on him. He'd become the very thing he used to maintain, except now he could see every flaw in the system with perfect clarity—and do nothing to fix it.

Three seconds.

The businessman's muscles tensed. Jin pushed every bit of his consciousness into making his red light brighter, more insistent. Sometimes, he could do that much at least. The delivery truck accelerated.

One second.

The businessman stepped forward—then jerked back as the delivery truck roared through, close enough that the wind ruffled his suit jacket. The near-miss left him pale and shaking. The young mother behind him clutched her stroller tighter.

Yellow light. Four seconds.

The shift in signal color brought its usual wave of disorientation as Jin's perception changed. Yellow always showed him the truth of things, stripped of pretense. He could see the businessman's fear melt into embarrassment, then anger at himself. The delivery driver's stress wasn't just about schedules—his daughter was sick, and he was behind on medical payments. The young mother wasn't as calm as she appeared; her white-knuckled grip on the stroller betrayed her anxiety about crossing streets since the accident that had taken her husband.

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

Another shift in perception. Now Jin could see the paths not taken, the better choices available. The businessman could have left home ten minutes earlier. The delivery company could have hired more drivers. The young widow could have taken the pedestrian bridge two blocks over. But humans rarely took the optimal path—that was something Jin had learned watching thousands of cycles of human behavior.

The intersection cleared. Red light again.

"Still watching the world go by, old friend?"

The voice belonged to Sebastian Volt, one of the few people who knew what Jin had become. The former electrical engineer often stopped by during his late-night walks, talking to what most people saw as just another traffic light.

"The Candlemakers' patrols are getting more frequent," Sebastian continued, leaning against the pole that was now part of Jin's existence. "They're searching for more illegal tech. But I think they're really looking for others like you—people changed by the Event."

Jin flickered his red light in acknowledgment. He'd seen the patrols, their blessed candles casting suspicious shadows as they searched for unauthorized sources of light. He'd seen how they lingered at certain intersections, studying the traffic signals with unusual interest.

"I've been doing some digging," Sebastian's voice dropped lower. "About what really happened during the Event. About why some people merged with technology instead of dying when the surge hit. I think—"

Yellow light.

Jin's perception shifted again, and he saw the truth Sebastian was hiding: fear, guilt, and something else—hope? But before he could analyze it further, movement caught his attention. A Candlemakers' patrol was turning onto the street, their white robes ghostly in the perpetual twilight.

Green light.

Jin saw the safe path immediately. He flickered his green light in a specific pattern—a code he and Sebastian had worked out. _Danger. Hide. West alley._

Sebastian straightened casually, adjusting his coat. "Same time tomorrow," he muttered, before walking away at an unhurried pace. He turned west at the next corner, vanishing into the shadows just as the patrol reached the intersection.

Red light again.

Jin watched the Candlemakers pass beneath him, their candles casting long shadows that seemed to reach for his pole with hungry fingers. One of them looked up at him, studying his light with narrowed eyes. Jin kept his red steady, betraying nothing.

Twenty-three seconds until yellow. Another cycle. Another slice of human life observed through his tricolored lens. Jin Chen, former traffic engineer, now eternal watcher, settled in for another long night of seeing all the accidents waiting to happen.

Sometimes he wondered if he was going mad. Other times, he wondered if his new perspective had finally shown him what sanity truly was.

The businessman was long gone, but others would come. They always did. And Jin would watch, and wait, and witness—because that was all he could do now.

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

The cycle continued.
