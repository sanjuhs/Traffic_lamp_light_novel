# Chapter 2: Flicker

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Jin watched Sebastian pace beneath him, something different in his friend's movement tonight. The usual nervous energy had crystallized into something harder, colder. Through the red phase, Jin could see the potential violence coiled in Sebastian's shoulders, the weight of the brass coin he kept flipping catching the dim candlelight.

"Barrowwill Thorne," Sebastian spat the name like poison. "Self-righteous bastard. Do you know what he did, Jin?"

Eighteen seconds.

Sebastian's coin caught the light again. Jin had seen that coin before—an old electrical conductor, transformed into something else during the Event. Like him, it held echoes of the old power.

"The Children's Light Foundation. They were helping kids affected by the Event, kids whose parents..." Sebastian's voice cracked. "They were using battery-powered lights. Safe ones. Just so the children could read at night, could feel normal for a few hours. Thorne shut them down. Had the volunteers arrested."

Twelve seconds.

Through his red-phase vision, Jin saw the luxury car approaching—Thorne's car, right on schedule. The Candlemaker official always took this route home, always hit this light. Jin had watched him pass hundreds of times, had seen the smug satisfaction on his face as he passed beneath the "properly sanctified" traffic signals.

"He's coming," Sebastian whispered, stepping back into the shadows. "Just like you said he would."

Eight seconds.

The coin spun faster in Sebastian's hands. Jin felt something strange—a resonance between his traffic light consciousness and the transformed metal. Both were relics of the electric age, both held powers they weren't meant to have.

Five seconds.

"You see everything during the yellow phase, don't you, Jin? The truth of things?" Sebastian's voice was barely audible. "Show me his truth. Show me if he deserves—"

Three seconds.

The coin stopped spinning. Sebastian held it edge-up, watching the approaching headlights. Jin felt the power building, like static before a storm. He could change the light early, keep it red, follow his programming—

One second.

The coin dropped. As it fell, Jin felt his consciousness splinter, forced between phases. Red-yellow-green all at once, a kaleidoscope of possibilities, truths, and paths. Through the chaos, he saw:

Red: Thorne's car approaching at exactly 42 kilometers per hour.
Yellow: The darkness in Thorne's heart, the pleasure he took in maintaining order through cruelty.
Green: A hundred possible paths, but all leading to the same intersection of fate and choice.

The coin hit the ground. Jin's light flickered—red-yellow-green-red-yellow—faster than any normal signal could change. The disruption lasted less than a second, but it was enough. Thorne's car swerved, startled by the strobing light. The wheel turned too far. Physics and fate took over.

The crash wasn't spectacular. Just a sharp turn, a skid on the wet pavement, and the crunch of metal meeting concrete. Thorne would live, Jin's red-phase sight told him that much. But the leg that had kicked down doors during raids would never work quite right again.

Yellow light. Four seconds.

The truth-sight showed Jin more than he wanted to see: Sebastian's satisfaction warring with guilt, Thorne's pain mixed with fear, and something darker spreading from the fallen coin—a ripple in the fabric of the city's reality.

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

Jin saw the branching consequences of what they'd done spreading out like cracks in glass. The optimal path had been to let Thorne pass unharmed. Every other route led to escalation, to more pain, to darker choices.

But they'd chosen this path now. No going back.

Red light.

"It's done," Sebastian retrieved his coin, now slightly warmer to the touch. "Thank you, Jin. I... I know that wasn't easy for you."

Jin flickered his light once, uncertain if it was acknowledgment or warning. He'd helped hurt someone deliberately. His purpose was to prevent accidents, not cause them. But he'd seen the truth of Thorne in his yellow phase, seen the lives ruined by the man's zealotry.

"I should go. Patrols will come soon." Sebastian pocketed the coin. "Jin... we might have to do worse things before this is over. The Candlemakers... what they're planning..." He trailed off, looking up at the traffic light that housed his friend's consciousness. "Would you help me again, if I asked?"

Jin gave no response. He couldn't. The patrol lights were already visible in the distance, drawn to the accident scene. But as he watched Sebastian disappear into the shadows, he processed the question through all three of his phases:

Red: He saw the potential for greater violence, for true catastrophe.
Yellow: He saw the corrupt truth at the heart of the Candlemakers' power.
Green: He saw no clear path that didn't lead to more darkness.

Twenty-three seconds until yellow.

The cycle continued, but something had changed. Tonight, the traffic light had been used as a weapon. Tonight, Jin had learned that even a fixed point in the city's grid could choose a different path.

He watched the patrol cars arrive, their blessed candles casting long shadows that seemed to dance with new purpose. Somewhere in the darkness, a coin grown warm with forbidden power lay waiting in Sebastian's pocket. And in the space between red and yellow and green, Jin wondered what other rules he might learn to break.

The cycle continued. But now it carried the weight of choice, and the price of intervention.
