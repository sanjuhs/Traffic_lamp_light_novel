Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Jin's consciousness expanded through his housing, processing the status information that had become visible to him since his evolution began. Level 4—he'd gained another level after the subway station incident. Each upgrade made the memory of his human life feel more distant, yet somehow sharper.

Eighteen seconds.

"I was ten when they first proposed the Celestial Shroud," Jin communicated through a pattern of light pulses that Sebastian had learned to read. Their usual nighttime conversation at the intersection had taken on new urgency since the gathering.

Fifteen seconds.

"The Petition of the Candlemakers," Sebastian nodded, leaning against Jin's pole. "A masterpiece of political manipulation. They claimed the sun was 'unfair competition.' Can you believe that? They actually argued that free natural light was hurting small businesses."

Ten seconds.

Through his yellow-phase sight, Jin pierced through layers of reality, seeing the truth of that long-ago petition. The signatures hadn't just been bought—they'd been marked with something else. Something that made his traffic light consciousness recoil.

Five seconds.

A truck was approaching too fast, its driver distracted by the shadows moving alongside his vehicle. Jin saw the impending crash in his red phase—a collision that would send the truck into a crowd of pedestrians waiting to cross.

Three seconds.

"Watch this," Sebastian whispered, flipping his coin. Jin felt the resonance between them grow stronger, amplifying his abilities. His status screen flickered with new information:

```
[TEMPORAL DISTORTION AMPLIFIED]
Range increased to 25 meters
Duration extended to 8 seconds
Warning: Unstable enhancement
```

One second.

Jin activated his red-phase power, creating a localized field of slowed time around the truck. The vehicle's momentum continued, but at a fraction of its normal speed. Through his enhanced perception, he watched as Sebastian's eyes widened in fascination.

Yellow light. Four seconds.

The truth-sight revealed more than just the truck's delayed trajectory. Jin could see the patterns of probability bending around the time dilation field, the way reality itself struggled to accommodate the manipulation. And deeper still, he saw something that made him glad he no longer had a human face to betray his horror.

The Celestial Shroud wasn't just blocking the sun. It was... digesting it.

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

"Beautiful," Sebastian breathed, watching the truck slowly complete its fall, its occupant frozen in a moment of realization. "Do you see how the temporal field interacts with the ambient darkness? The creatures avoid it completely. This is what I've been trying to tell everyone—we can fight back with more than just light."

But Jin's overlapping phases showed him the cost. Each use of his powers sent ripples through reality, attracting attention from things that lurked beyond the Shroud. The same things that had somehow been bound into the Candlemakers' petition two decades ago.

Red light.

The temporal field collapsed. The truck completed its fall in normal time, but along the safe path Jin had calculated. The driver emerged shaken but unharmed, unaware of how close he'd come to tragedy—or how his moment of danger had been used as a test.

"Your powers are growing faster than I anticipated," Sebastian said, his coin now uncomfortably warm in his palm. "The merger of traffic signal programming with... whatever the Event really was... it's creating something unprecedented."

Twenty seconds.

Jin pulsed his lights in a pattern that conveyed his growing suspicion: "You knew this would happen. You knew what the Event would do to people like me."

Fifteen seconds.

Sebastian's face showed guilt in the yellow phase, determination in the red, and something unreadable in the green. "We needed a way to fight back. The Candlemakers didn't just block the sun, Jin. They made a deal with something. Something that's been waiting for a chance like this for a very long time."

Ten seconds.

A shadow passed overhead—something vast moving behind the Celestial Shroud. Jin's status screen flickered with warnings:

```
[COSMIC ANOMALY DETECTED]
Threat level: Unknown
Warning: Reality Pierce ability insufficient for full analysis
```

Five seconds.

"The petition wasn't just about profits," Sebastian continued, his voice dropping to a whisper. "It was a contract. The Candlemakers offered up the sun itself in exchange for power. And now that same power is starting to show up in transformed technology. In you."

Three seconds.

Jin's consciousness expanded further, processing this revelation through all his phases at once. The truth was there in the patterns: the Candlemakers hadn't just blocked the sun—they'd traded it. And now, whatever they'd traded it to was watching the city's experiments with transformed technology with great interest.

One second.

"Keep practicing," Sebastian said, pocketing his coin. "You're not just a traffic light anymore, Jin. You're becoming something they never expected. Something that might finally let us tear down the Shroud."

Yellow light.

But in his truth-sight, Jin saw what Sebastian couldn't: tearing down the Shroud might do more than just bring back the sun. It might also free whatever vast intelligence had purchased it in the first place.

The cycle continued, but each rotation brought Jin closer to understanding the true nature of his transformation—and the cosmic game he'd been unwittingly drawn into.

His status screen flickered one last time:

```
[NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED]
Analyzing...
Warning: Unknown power source detected
