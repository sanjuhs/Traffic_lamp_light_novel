# Chapter 9: Wax and Wane

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

"Before the Republic," Thorne continued, his voice taking on the cadence of a historian reciting forbidden texts, "humanity lived in clusters of light. Holy sites, blessed grounds, anywhere the darkness couldn't quite reach. We called them Candleholds."

Through his enhanced perception, Jin processed both Thorne's words and the growing shadows around them. His status screen flickered with historical analysis:

```
[ACCESSING HISTORICAL RECORDS]
Pre-Republic Era detected
Warning: Some records appear artificially altered
Temporal anomalies detected in historical narrative
```

Eighteen seconds.

"The Candlemaker Guilds were kingmakers then," Thorne's hands shook as he gripped his cane tighter. "Every warlord, every petty tyrant needed them. Not just for light—for survival. The dark things were stronger then, hungry for any human who strayed from blessed illumination."

Fifteen seconds.

Jin's yellow-phase sight pierced through layers of historical truth: images of huddled masses in cathedral-like structures, their walls lined with eternal flames. Children who never saw beyond their Candlehold's boundaries. Societies stunted by the limits of their illumination.

Ten seconds.

"Democracy?" Thorne laughed bitterly. "We thought it would free us. Representative government, free markets, the power of the vote. But the Candlemakers adapted. They didn't need to rule through force anymore—not when they could rule through legislation."

Five seconds.

Jin detected movement at the edge of his perception. Someone approaching, carrying something that made his traffic light consciousness hum with recognition. Through his red-phase vision, he saw potential trajectories splitting like fractal patterns.

Three seconds.

"The Republic gave them something the old warlords never could," Thorne continued, unaware of the approaching figure. "Legitimacy. Legal framework. The right to negotiate with powers that should never have been bargained with—"

One second.

"That's enough, Thorne." Lisa's voice cut through the darkness like a blade. She stepped into Jin's field of view, and his every phase reacted simultaneously:

Red: The gun in her hands—not standard issue, something modified with blessed components.
Yellow: The truth of her uniform—she wasn't just resistance, she was something else entirely.
Green: The optimal paths suddenly shrinking to nearly nothing.

Yellow light. Four seconds.

Through his truth-sight, Jin saw Lisa transformed. Gone was the grieving friend who ate lunch beneath his housing. This Lisa wore dark green tactical gear with official Candlemaker insignia, a blue-flame blessed candle at her hip that radiated authority. Her gun combined electrical components with blessed wax in ways that shouldn't have been possible.

"Agent Lisa Chen," Thorne nodded, seemingly unsurprised. "I wondered when Internal Affairs would find me."

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

Jin's status screen erupted with warnings:

```
[MULTIPLE THREATS DETECTED]
- Blessed Electrical Weapon (Unknown Configuration)
- High-Ranking Candlemaker Agent
- Reality Distortion Field Activating
Warning: Temporal interference detected
```

"You've been spreading dangerous ideas, Thorne," Lisa's voice was professional, cold. "Questioning the Contract. Talking to traffic lights as if they're sentient." Her eyes flicked up to Jin's housing, and for a moment, he saw something flicker behind her official mask. Recognition?

Red light.

"Tell me, Agent Chen," Thorne's voice took on a dangerous edge. "Did they tell you what really happened to Jin? Did they tell you why certain traffic lights started acting strange after the Contract was signed?"

Twenty seconds.

Lisa's gun didn't waver, but Jin saw the truth in his yellow phase—doubt, fear, and underneath it all, a desperate hope she wouldn't admit even to herself.

Fifteen seconds.

"The old ways weren't perfect," Thorne continued, his voice growing stronger. "The warlords, the Candleholds, the restricted lives. But at least then we knew what we were: prisoners of the dark. Now? Now we're shareholders in our own imprisonment, voting for the chains that bind us—"

Ten seconds.

"I said that's enough." Lisa's finger tightened on the trigger. Through his enhanced perception, Jin saw the weapon's dual nature—electrical charge wrapped in blessed wax, technology and faith merged into something that could probably destroy a transformed traffic light with a single shot.

Five seconds.

Jin's consciousness expanded, processing multiple threats: Lisa's weapon, the gathering shadows drawn to Thorne's forbidden knowledge, and something else—a presence above them, watching through the Celestial Shroud with growing interest.

Three seconds.

"He's still in there, isn't he?" Thorne's words cut through the tension. "Your friend Jin. In that traffic light. Watching. Learning. Evolving. That's why you eat lunch here every day, isn't it? Because some part of you knows—"

One second.

Lisa's gun shifted slightly, now pointing directly at Jin's housing. Her blessed candle flared brighter, its blue flame casting shadows that moved against the natural flow of light.

"Don't make me do this," she whispered, and Jin couldn't tell if she was talking to Thorne or to him.

The cycle continued, but the next color would change everything.

And in the space between seconds, Jin had to make a choice that would reveal his true nature to the woman he once loved, who now held the power to either save or destroy him.

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

The darkness held its breath.
