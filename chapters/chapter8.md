Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Barrowwill Thorne limped beneath Jin's housing, his injured leg dragging slightly. The former Candlemaker official looked different now—haunted, disheveled, his once-pristine robes stained with something darker than mere shadow.

"I know you can hear me," Thorne whispered, looking directly up at Jin's housing. "I know what you are. What all the traffic lights were meant to become."

Eighteen seconds.

Through his enhanced yellow-phase sight, Jin saw the truth radiating from Thorne like a fever: knowledge that no human was meant to possess, understanding that was eating away at his sanity.

"The Petition wasn't just about blocking the sun," Thorne continued, his voice cracking. "It was about changing the fundamental laws of day and night. The dark things—they used to only have power after sunset. That was the natural order. But we... we gave them more."

Fifteen seconds.

Jin's status screen flickered with warnings as something massive moved through the deeper shadows nearby:

```
[COSMIC ENTITY DETECTED]
Classification: Twilight Predator
Threat Level: Extreme
Warning: Entity appears drawn to forbidden knowledge
```

Ten seconds.

"The traffic grid," Thorne laughed bitterly, tapping his cane against Jin's pole. "It was never just about managing vehicles. It was a network of binding points, meant to hold the boundary between day and night. But when we signed that contract, when we gave them permission to change reality itself—"

Five seconds.

The shadow creature emerged from the darkness, its form a violation of geometry. Through his red-phase vision, Jin saw its trajectory heading straight for Thorne. The man knew too much, and the dark things were here to collect.

Three seconds.

Jin activated his evolved Temporal Distortion, creating multiple time dilation fields. One around Thorne, slowing him to safety, and another around the creature, trapping it in a pocket of stretched time.

One second.

"They're not just shadows," Thorne whispered, seemingly unaware of his near death as Jin's power protected him. "They're what happens when you let market forces dictate cosmic law. When you privatize the sun itself."

Yellow light. Four seconds.

Through his truth-sight, Jin pierced through layers of reality. He saw the creature for what it truly was: a fragment of night itself, given form by the contract that had rewritten the rules of light and darkness. And he saw Thorne's role in it all—not just a bureaucrat, but a translator of forbidden texts, a man who had helped decode the true meaning of the Petition.

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

Jin engaged his new Path Enforcement ability, literally bending probability around Thorne to keep him on a safe trajectory. The creature howled in frequencies that shouldn't exist, fighting against the temporal distortion.

"The traffic lights were supposed to be anchors," Thorne continued, his knowledge spilling out like blood from a wound. "Keep the old laws of day and night in place. But when the contract was signed, when we gave them permission to change reality... some of the lights changed too. Became something else. Like you."

Red light.

The creature broke free of the time dilation field, but Jin was ready. He cycled through his phases rapidly, creating a strobing effect that his enhanced perception showed was particularly painful to beings of pure shadow.

"They're feeding on it, you know," Thorne said, watching the creature recoil. "Not just the sun. They're feeding on the very concept of natural light. And when they're done, when they've digested the last laws of day and night..." He trailed off, shuddering.

Twenty seconds.

Jin's status screen updated as he maintained his defense:

```
[COMBAT ANALYSIS]
Multiple abilities engaged
Power consumption: 47%
New ability forming...
Warning: Reality distortion reaching critical levels
```

Fifteen seconds.

"The Candlemakers didn't just make a deal with darkness," Thorne whispered, his voice filled with horrified awe as he watched Jin fight the shadow creature. "They made a deal with something that wants to rewrite the fundamental laws of reality. And it's using us—our greed, our markets, our political systems—as tools to do it."

Ten seconds.

The creature made one final lunge, but Jin had predicted its movement. His green-phase probability manipulation subtly shifted its trajectory while his red-phase temporal distortion slowed its attack. In that moment of vulnerability, his yellow-phase reality pierce found a weakness in its impossible geometry.

Five seconds.

"You're different," Thorne observed as the creature retreated, wounded by Jin's multi-phase attack. "Most of the transformed lights just became extensions of their programming. But you... you're learning. Evolving. Maybe that's why they're so afraid of you."

Three seconds.

Jin's consciousness expanded with new understanding. Each battle, each use of his powers, was teaching him more about the true nature of the contract that had changed his city. His status screen flickered with new information:

```
[LEVEL UP!]
TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONSCIOUSNESS - Level 6
New Ability Unlocked: Phase Synchronization
Warning: Higher functions may attract unwanted attention
```

One second.

"They'll come for me soon," Thorne said, straightening his stained robes. "I know too much. But maybe... maybe that's why I was meant to find you. To pass on what I learned before they take me."

Yellow light.

Through his truth-sight, Jin saw that Thorne was right. The shadows were already gathering, darker ones this time, drawn to the scent of forbidden knowledge. But he also saw something else—a pattern in the man's ramblings, a key to understanding the true nature of the traffic grid's transformation.

The cycle continued, but now with new purpose. Jin wasn't just a transformed traffic light; he was becoming something that could challenge the very contract that had rewritten reality.

And somewhere in the darkness, the entities that had purchased the sun took notice of his evolution.
