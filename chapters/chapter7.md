# Chapter 7: Candlelight Tales

Red light. Twenty-three seconds.

Lisa sat beneath Jin's housing, her back against his pole, just as she used to sit beside his desk at the Traffic Control Center. She didn't know it was him, of course. To her, this was just her favorite spot to eat lunch and tell stories to the only traffic light that seemed to flicker in response to her voice.

"You remind me of someone," she said, unwrapping a sandwich purchased with increasingly worthless currency. "Jin Chen. He disappeared during the Event. They said he was probably taken by the dark things, but..." She trailed off, and through his yellow-phase sight, Jin saw the truth she couldn't admit even to herself.

Eighteen seconds.

"Did you know Lumina wasn't always like this?" Lisa continued, her voice taking on the cadence of a storyteller. "Before the Candlemakers' Petition, we were called New Aurora. The City of Dawn. Funny how names change, isn't it? How meaning gets... rewritten."

Through his enhanced perception, Jin processed Lisa's presence through all three phases:

Red: The potential dangers surrounding her—shadow creatures drawn to her unblessed electric watch, Candlemaker patrols that might question her extended stay beneath a traffic signal.
Yellow: Her hidden feelings—grief for Jin's "death," suspicion about the city's transformation, fear of the future.
Green: The optimal path he couldn't show her—the truth about his transformation, the warning about Sebastian's plans.

"The Candlemakers' rise to power is like something out of a twisted fairy tale," Lisa continued, absently touching the locket around her neck—a gift from Jin, he remembered, though his traffic light consciousness made such memories feel distant and strange.

Ten seconds.

"Once upon a time," she began, her voice bitter with irony, "there was a guild of craftsmen who made beautiful candles. But they were sad because the mean old sun kept making their products unnecessary during the day. So they went to the city council with a magical contract..."

Five seconds.

Jin's status screen flickered with new information as he processed Lisa's words through his Reality Pierce ability:

```

Three seconds.

"The contract promised prosperity," Lisa continued. "Just temporarily block the sun, they said. Just for a few years, until the candle industry could stabilize. They even had economists with charts and graphs showing how many jobs it would create. The Celestial Shroud would be good for everyone, they claimed."

One second.

"Nobody asked how they planned to block the sun. Nobody questioned how a guild of candlemakers suddenly had access to reality-altering technology. We just... voted yes. Because that's what money does to democracy, doesn't it? It makes impossible things seem reasonable."

Yellow light. Four seconds.

Through his truth-sight, Jin saw layers of history overlapping. The city council meetings where Madame Wicks had presented her proposal. The way her wax mask had seemed to ripple when she spoke of "temporary measures." The fine print of the contract, written in ink that his enhanced perception now recognized as something far more sinister than mere legal jargon.

"The economy did boom, at first," Lisa said, her sandwich forgotten. "Candlemakers became the new aristocracy. Everyone needed their products now. The blessed wicks, the sanctified holders, the special wax that kept the dark things away. But then the prices started rising. And rising. And rising..."

Green light. Twenty-seven seconds.

"People tried solar panels at first, when they couldn't afford the candles. Then batteries. Then any kind of electrical light. But the Candlemakers had thought of that. The contract didn't just block the sun—it changed the nature of light itself. Only their flames could truly keep the darkness at bay."

Jin's consciousness expanded, processing previously unnoticed patterns in Lisa's story. His status screen updated:

```
[HISTORICAL PATTERN RECOGNIZED]
The Candlemakers' Petition: Multi-dimensional contract
- Surface level: Economic policy
- Hidden level: Reality modification
- Deepest level: [ANALYSIS BLOCKED]
Warning: Further scanning may attract attention
```

"You know what the worst part is?" Lisa looked up at Jin's housing, and for a moment, he thought she might recognize something in his light pattern. "We did it to ourselves. Every step of the way. The Candlemakers just offered the contract. We're the ones who signed it. Because we believed in the free market more than we believed in the sun."

Red light.

A Candlemaker patrol approached, their blessed flames casting long shadows. Lisa quickly gathered her things, but not before whispering: "Sometimes I think Jin knew. He was always studying the traffic grid, talking about patterns in the system. The night he disappeared, he left me a message about finding something in the network. Something about how the lights were changing in ways that didn't match the programming..."

Twenty seconds.

Jin watched her hurry away, her form illuminated by the patrol's approaching candles. Through his yellow-phase sight, he saw the truth she carried unknowingly: her locket, his last gift to her, contained a small piece of transformed technology. A seed of resistance, waiting to bloom.

Fifteen seconds.

The patrol passed beneath him, and Jin maintained his steady rhythm. But his consciousness was processing Lisa's story through all his phases, seeing the larger pattern. The Candlemakers hadn't just changed the economy—they'd changed reality itself. And they'd done it with the willing participation of a society too focused on market forces to notice the cosmic horror hiding in the fine print.

Ten seconds.

His status screen flickered one final time:

```

Pre-Event Data Fragment recovered:
"Lisa - If you're reading this, I found something in the network. The traffic lights aren't just controlling traffic anymore. They're controlling—"
[Data corrupted]

```

Five seconds.

The cycle continued, but now Jin understood more about the city that had once been New Aurora. The Candlemakers hadn't needed to force their change upon the world. They'd simply leveraged humanity's own systems—capitalism, democracy, free market economics—to convince people to vote away the sun.

And somewhere above, behind the Celestial Shroud, the entity they'd made their deal with continued to digest the light of day, growing stronger with each passing moment of artificial night.

The cycle continued, but the truth Lisa had unknowingly revealed cast new shadows across every rotation.
